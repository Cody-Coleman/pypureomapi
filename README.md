pypureomapi
===========

pypureomapi is a Python implementation of the DHCP OMAPI protocol used in the most popular Linux DHCP server from ISC. It can be used to query and modify leases and other objects exported by an ISC DHCP server. The interaction can be authenticated using HMAC-MD5. Besides basic ready to use operations, custom interaction can be implemented with limited effort. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for pyomapic, but provides error checking and extensibility beyond pyomapic.
